### Welcome (insert your name here) 👋

Hi there! My name is Hernan Lanusse but everyone calls me Jota (if you want to know why you’ll have to hire me). I am 19 years old and as you can see, I’m a programmer. I am currently studying software engineering but meanwhile I look for all sorts of challenges and opportunities, so if you have an interesting project/job don't hesitate to contact me.

- 🔭 I’m currently studying software engineering in the University of Buenos Aires.
- 🌱 I’m learning Rust the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jotalanusse), [Email](mailTo:jotalanusse@gmail.com), or even on Discord @jotalanusse#1337.

💬 Ask me anything, but specially about:
- JavaScript / TypeScript, C#, SQL, Python, Java, Rust
- NodeJs, ExpressJs / NestJs, WPF, .NET
- MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- Docker, Microservices, RabbitMQ
- Linux, Windows, TempleOS (just kidding)

🚀 Some of my main public side projects (_it ain't much, but it's honest work_):
- [The Bartender](https://github.com/jotalanusse/the-bartender) - The best Discord bot for sad people (satire project).
- [Minety](https://github.com/jotalanusse/minety) - A set of tools and utilities for Minecraft (fun?).

⚡ Fun facts:
- If you can make better pancakes than me you automatically earn my respect.
- I will work for Bitcoin / Etherum.
