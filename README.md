### Welcome (insert your name here) 👋

Hi there! I'm Jota Lanusse (my actual name is Hernan). I am 20.8 years old and as you can see, I’m a programmer. At the moment I'm studying software engineering, but meanwhile I look for all sorts of challenges and opportunities, so if you have an interesting project/job don't hesitate to contact me.

- 🔭 I’m currently studying software engineering at the **Polytechnic University of Catalonia**.
- 🌱 I’m learning **Design of Data-Intensive Applications** at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jotalanusse), [Personal email](mailto:jotalanusse@gmail.com?subject=Hi%20Jota!%20let's%20talk), [Business email](mailto:jota@moonara.io?subject=Hi%20Jota!%20let's%20talk), or even on Discord @ [jotalanusse#1337](https://discordapp.com/users/322189982557143041).

💬 Ask me anything, but specially about:
- TypeScript (Js), C#, SQL, Python, Java, Rust, Lua
- NodeJs, ExpressJs / NestJs, WPF, .NET
- MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- Docker, Microservices, RabbitMQ
- Linux, Windows, TempleOS (just kidding)

- [Minety](https://github.com/jotalanusse/minety) - A set of tools and utilities for Minecraft (fun?).

⚡ Fun facts:
